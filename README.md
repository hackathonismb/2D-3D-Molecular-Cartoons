# 2D-3D-Molecular-Cartoons

## Objective
2D representations of a 3D structure is very useful in understanding the structure. We are going to show the 2D cartoon in three different levels: chain lvel, domain level, and secondary structure level. Our main focus will be the domain level 2D cartoon.

## Steps to show 2D cartoon in the domain level
1. Get the residue range for each domain
  
2. Find the center and width and length of the area (XY plane) covered by the atoms in the domain

3. Show the domains in SVG as ovals using the center, width, and length

4. Use simple shapes (e.g., triangles, rectangles, ovals, hexagone, pentagon, etc) to represent the domains. Add some 3D effect and label to the shape.

5. Show the domains in SVG using the cartoons generated from step 4.
